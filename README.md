# React-Native-CurrencyConverter

## Install Expo CLI

Assuming that you have Node 10+ installed, you can use npm to install the Expo CLI command line utility:

    npm install -g expo-cli

## After cloning, run these commands

    cd React-Native-CurrencyConverter

    npm start # you can also use: expo start

This will start a development server for you.

## Running your React Native application
Install the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.

## Modifying your app
Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it. Open App.js in your text editor of choice and edit some lines. The application should reload automatically once you save your changes.

## That's it!
Congratulations! You've successfully run and modified your first React Native app.
